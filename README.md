# NLW Badge

 A tweaked version of the base [**NLW Badge**](https://github.com/Maymisk/NLWbadge)


## My Journey

This badge is a tweaked version of 👆 that badge - it has a fancy background and fancy hover effects 🦍.

*While simple, this project was what made me realize how much cool stuff I could do with CSS.*


## Installation

Install the project to play around with the FX 😝

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Maymisk/NLWbadge.git
```
    
## Screenshots

## Note

When I got back to this project, I noticed some JavaScript variables were missing and a couple things were not named.. ideally. **Now fixed, 2 years later 😘**
